h2. Development

I don't use Coffee script, so for the enhancements the javascript source was changed directly.

h2. Documentation

SlidesJS version 3.0 documentation is available at "http://slidesjs.com/":http://slidesjs.com/

h3. Enhancements

* Added @scale@ (bool) setting, default @true@. Setting it to @false@ will prevent adding @width: 100%@ css to all images.
* The script now checks if the various navigation elements don't already exist on the page. This allows for custom postioning.
